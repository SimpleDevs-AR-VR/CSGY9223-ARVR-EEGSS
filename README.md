## About this repo:

This repository is a wrapper repository meant to finalize the submission for CS-GY 9223 "SELECTED TOPICS IN CS: VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY" course. It doesn't contain the actual repo history, as that's a private repository. If a github repo history is required for proof of independent work, please contact me.

Included in this file are the following:

* `muse2_stream.ipynb`: the Python code that handles EEG streaming and processing. Contains the full README - this readme.txt is purely to guide you to that file.
* `ARVR-EEGSS.apk`: The VR application that can be sideloaded into a Meta Quest Pro. Please refer to instructions in `muse2_stream.ipynb` for more information.
* `sample.zip`: contains sample EEG data that you can use to dummy-test the EEG processing step in `muse2_stream.ipynb`.

Have a great day!
